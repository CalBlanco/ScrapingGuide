# Scraping Guide by Cal Blanco

In this repo I hope to show people the basics of webscraping. I wanted to make the guide just this readme but github had other ideas for the embedded images and videos. So the guide can be found in `scraping_guide.pdf`. This did however make the final demo video not work but all the important content is in there.

Hope there is information that helps you in your scraping journey!

## Imports
Needed imports are specified at the top of each actual guide. I did not want to make a requirements file because I had a couple of imports that are not needed or are not used in the development of this guide.

### All Imports Needed
- `requests`
- `selenium`
- `beautifulsoup4`

### Optional
- `glom` (for easily parsing nested objects, I did use this so if you are following the guide verbatim you should download this)
- `jupyter` (for running code in notebooks.)
