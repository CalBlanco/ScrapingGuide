# Scraping Guide by Cal Blanco

In this repo I hope to show people the basics of webscraping. I wanted to make the guide just this readme but github had other ideas for the embedded images and videos. So the guide can be found in `scraping_guide.pdf`. This did however make the final demo video not work but all the important content is in there.

Hope there is information that helps you in your scraping journey!
